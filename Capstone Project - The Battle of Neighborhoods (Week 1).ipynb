    "The purpose of this project is to determine the similarity between various multicultural cities. This could have a casual purpose, if someone would like move to a different multicultural city, and would like to know how similar it is to determine whether they would be able to adapt to that location. However, it could serve a more professional purpose, if a contractor wanted to start a new business, and has or knows of a successful business in a multicultural city, then he or she could choose a new location that is similar to the old multicultural city."
